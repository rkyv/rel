- [ ] Extension methods for boxy types (e.g. `Box`, `OwnedVal`) that return an `In` (e.g. `deref_in`)
- [ ] Write a rel version of the `rust_serialization_benchmark` benchmarks
  - [x] `mesh` first because it is very simple
  - [x] `log`
  - [*] `minecraft_savedata` for stress testing
- [ ] Intern `RelString` with a custom implementation (instead of using `RelVec`) to speed up serialization
- [ ] Should `In<P, Q>: DerefMut where P: DerefMut, P::Target: Unpin`?
- [ ] Provide some allocators from a crate like `rel_allocator`
- [ ] Extension methods for `RegionalAllocator` and `RawRegionalAllocator` that return an `In` from `Allocate`
- [ ] Add CI checks that:
  - [ ] Check formatting
  - [ ] Run clippy
  - [ ] Run the example
  - [ ] Run the example under MIRI with MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-strict-provenance"
  - [ ] Build docs

Backlog
- [ ] Write derive macro for `DebugRaw`
- [ ] Make `RegionalAllocator`/`RawRegionalAllocator` less wordy
- [ ] Add `RelMut` to parallel `RefRef`
- [ ] Add support for subslicing in `IndexRaw` and `IndexMutRaw` by adding a `SliceIndex` type
- [ ] Add support for runtime regions by creating a fresh `Unique` value and associating it with an allocated object. Then dynamically check whether a memory segment is located in that region and create an `In` to carry that invariant.
- [ ] Make derive macros optional for all crates?
- [ ] Add more robust testing for `no_std` compatibility
- [ ] Figure out how to provide an `Emplace` derive
  - [ ] Maybe `#[derive(Emplace)] #[emplace(RelFoo, RelBar, ...)]`
  - [ ] This is supposed to be rkyv's job?
